      "HONG KONG: Asian markets started 2015 on an upswing in limited trading on Friday, with mainland Chinese stocks surging in Hong Kong on speculation Beijing may ease monetary policy to boost slowing growth.Hong Kong rose 1.07 percent, closing 252.78 points higher at 23857.82.Seoul closed up 0.57 percent, rising 10.85 points to 1,926.44, while Sydney gained 0.46 percent, or 24.89 points, to close at 5,435.9.Singapore edged up 0.19 percent, gaining 6.39 points to 3,371.54.Markets in mainland China, Japan, Taiwan, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Thailand remained closed for holidays.With mainland bourses shut until January 5, shares in Chinese developers and financial companies surged in Hong Kong, stoked by hopes that Beijing could ease monetary policy to support lagging growth in the world´s second-largest economy.China Vanke, the country´s biggest developer by sales, leapt 10.8 percent and the People´s Insurance Company (Group) of China Ltd. was up 5.51 percent in afternoon trading.Train-builders CSR Corp. and China CNR Corp. soared -- CSR by 16.5 percent and China CNR by 16.0 percent -- extending gains on December 31 after they announced a merger agreement.China´s manufacturing growth dropped in December to its lowest level of 2014, an official survey showed Thursday, as the sector struggles with weak domestic demand.China´s official Purchasing Managers´ Index (PMI) released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) came in at 50.1 last month, down from 50.3 recorded in November.The index, which tracks activity in factories and workshops, is considered a key indicator of the health of China´s economy, a major driver of global growth. A figure above 50 signals expansion, while anything below indicates contraction.\"Growth momentum is still insufficient,\" NBS said in a statement. - Investors eye US factory data -On forex markets the dollar extended gains ahead of the release of American factory data due later on Friday and following a steady stream of good news from the world´s biggest economy.The dollar bought 120.44 yen, compared to 119.44 yen in final 2014 trading on Wednesday.Wall Street toasted a banner year in 2014, with US equity markets finishing near all-time highs.The euro meanwhile slipped amid growing expectations that the European Central Bank, which meets on January 22, will start buying sovereign bonds.
